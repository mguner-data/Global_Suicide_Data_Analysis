# Global_Suicide_Data_Analysis

Project 1 for group 7

Project Title: An Analysis of the World Suicide Data

Team Members: Mujgan Guner, Ahmet Lotfy, Shanker Nair

Project Description/Outline:

Suicide is a global phenomenon that occurs throughout the lifespan and considered as a public health problem around the world. The scope of this study is to analyze a dataset of global suicide data from 1985 to 2016, which consists of the number of deaths by suicide by year, countries, demographics and the gross domestic product (GDP) as the quantitative variables. The qualitative variables are gender, age buckets and generation classification. The broad scope of the study is to understand the relationship between the suicide rates relating to the demographics and socio-economic state of the various countries in the study and also a more granular study by slicing the data in different ways.

Research Questions to Answer:

In general, the questions to focus on during the study are as follows: • What is the global trend in suicide rate over the years? How does suicide rate and economies of the countries correlate? • Are men or women more likely to commit suicide? • What is the relationship between age groups and generation on suicide rates? • What are the top 5 countries with the highest suicide rates in the world? • What are the top countries with highest suicide rates per continent?

Datasets to Be Used:

For this study, “Suicide rates overview 1985 to 2016” data will be used. The data is obtained in “csv” format from Kaggle.(https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016)

Breakdown of Tasks:

• Data QA / QC and cleanup. • Data slicing and wrangling for analysis. o Grouping of data by country, gender, age, year, GDP. • Statistical analysis of quantitative data. • Creating various plots to observe the data distributions and correlations. • Summarizing data with insights and drawing conclusions from the analysis.

TO DO (Tasks):

What is the global trend in suicide rate over the years? -Do analysis only for subset of data with countries having data in same years

Gender, age group and generation analysis
Analysis by continent
How does suicide rate and economies of the countries correlate?

Possibly choose few countries(3) and look at gdp v. suicide rate (scatter plot)
Line plots of GDP and suicide rate on Y avis and year on x axis (Choose countries based on economy)
3a) Are men or women more likely to commit suicide? 3b) What is the relationship between age groups and generation on suicide rates? - Get more granular on this since we have already looked at it on global scale (Maybe North America etc)

What are the top 5 or 10 countries with the highest suicide rates in the world?

What are the top countries with highest suicide rates per continent?

If we get to the continent exercise, we can maybe pull top and bottom 2 or 3 countries per continent.
Relationship between population and GDP (This has nothing to do with suicide, but just to look)

Relationship between population and suicide rate.
